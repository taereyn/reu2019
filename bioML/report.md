# SBML Solver Project

## Abstract


### Motivation 
This paper presents Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) solver which is a extensible, high-performance, cross-platform, open-source software library. SBML is a shared library that loads, compiles and executes models written in the SBML language. The solver is designed to be included into other existing programs. The SBML solver fits into a suite of physics (fluids, soft-matter, visco-elastic) and computational biology called ‘Mechanica’. This module is designed to calculate the time evolution of a chemical network that’s attached to some simulated physical object (such as cell, membrane, volume), so forth.

   Building the SBML solver involves tracking down a lot of dependencies and it’s important for users who want to compile it to have clear instructions on how to do so. The SBML Solver will also be connected to integrate a PhysiCell software package. 


### Results 

Results

### Availability and Implementation 

The SBML solver is available to run on Mac OS X, Linux and Windows. 

## Introduction

Introduction 

## Methodology 

1. Explain the documentation process
   Documenting the build system of a software module that will be used in a number of products.  
  
   Explain the results
   1. Needed libxml2 to run
   2. Needed zlib1g
   3. Needed libncurses 
   
### Explain the uses of

1. Linux
      Open source software
      Distributions are different versions such as Ubuntu and Mint 
      Focuses on security and durability
   
2. Git
      Git is a distributed version-control system for tracking changes in source code during software development
      It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files
  
3. Ccmake
      
4. Cmake
      Cross-platform free and open-source software tool for managing the build process of software using a compiler-independent method. 
      Very useful with development of makefiles

 5. Gcc
      GNU Compiler Collection 
      An integrated distribution of compilers for several major programming languages
      C, C++ and Java
